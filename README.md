# 42IRC
This project is about creating an IRC server.
\
Using HexChat (an actual IRC client) to connect to the server and test it.

Internet is ruled by solid standards protocols that allow connected computers to interact with each other.
\
Itâ€™s always a good thing to know.

## Intro

### What is an IRC
### What is IRC?
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a protocol for real-time text communication over the internet. It facilitates group (many-to-many) communication in discussion forums called channels, as well as one-on-one (private) messaging.

### Key Features
1. **Channels**: These are chat rooms that can be joined by multiple users. Channels are usually prefixed with a `#` (e.g., `#example`).
2. **Private Messaging**: Users can send direct messages to each other.
3. **Nicknames**: Users identify themselves with unique nicknames.
4. **Servers and Networks**: IRC operates on a client-server model where users connect to an IRC server, which may be part of a larger network of servers.

## Setup

Install HexChat
Setup HexChat

```
git clone https://www.github.com/jlebre/42IRC.git
cd 42IRC/ft_irc
make a
```

"make a" deletes all files, compiles the program, and runs it in port 6667 and using "hello" as password.

#

## Step by step

The main function:
```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	Server irc;
	irc.parse(argc, argv);
	return 0;
}
```
This function creates a Server object and sends the arguments to parse.

```cpp
void    Server::parse(int argc, char **argv)
{
	if (argc != 3)
	{
		std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <port> <password>" << std::endl;
		return;
	}
    _sock.port = std::atoi(argv[1]);
    if (_sock.port < 1024)
        std::cerr << "Port should be a number between 1024 and 65534\n";
    _password = argv[2];
    _sock.ip = "127.0.0.1";
    _max_clients = MAX_CLIENTS;
    n_events = 1;
    init_socket();
    init_poll();
	main_loop();
}
```

Here we check wether the number of arguments is correct, we attribute values to _sock.port and to _password.

Then we init the socket.

```cpp
void Server::init_socket()
{
	// CREATE SOCKET
	_sock.fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, getprotobyname("TCP")->p_proto);
	if (_sock.fd == -1)
	{
		std::cerr << "Error: (Create Socket) " << std::strerror(errno) << std::endl;
		exit(1);
	}

	// BIND SOCKET
	struct sockaddr_in _addr;
	_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
	_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(_sock.ip.c_str());
	_addr.sin_port = htons(_sock.port);

	if (bind(_sock.fd, (struct sockaddr *)&_addr, sizeof(_addr)) == -1)
	{
		std::cerr << "Error: (Bind) " << std::strerror(errno) << std::endl;
		exit(1);
	}

	// LISTEN SOCKET
	if (listen(_sock.fd, _max_clients) == -1)
	{
		std::cerr << "Error: (Listen) " << std::strerror(errno) << std::endl;
		exit(1);
	}
	std::cout << "Listening on " << _sock.fd << std::endl;
}
```

#

## EPOLL
Similar to poll(), but it is more efficient in handling a large number of fds.

### Functions
1. int epoll_create1(int flags):
\
Create an epoll instance and returns the file descriptor referring to that instance.

2. int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int option, int fd, struct epoll_event *event):
\
Manages the list of file descriptors that the epoll instance should monitor.
    "option" can be EPOLL_CTL_ADD, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, EPOLL_CTL_DEL.

```
EPOLL_CTL_ADD:
Add an entry to the interest list of the epoll file
descriptor, epfd.  The entry includes the file descriptor,
fd, a reference to the corresponding open file description.

EPOLL_CTL_MOD:
Change the settings associated with fd in the interest
list to the new settings specified in event.

EPOLL_CTL_DEL:
Remove (deregister) the target file descriptor fd from the
interest list.  The event argument is ignored and can be
NULL (but see BUGS below).
```

3. int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int max_events, int timeout):
\
Waits for events on the epoll instance.

```cpp
void	Server::init_poll()
{
	_event.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLOUT;
	_event.data.fd = _sock.fd;
	_events[0].data.fd = _sock.fd;

	event_fd = epoll_create1(0);

	epoll_ctl(event_fd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, _sock.fd, &_event);

	memset(&_events, 0, sizeof(_events));
}
```
```
EPOLLIN:
Available for read operations.

EPOLLOUT:
Available for write operations.
```

# Classes
## Server Class

To send a message to the client we use the function reply, that takes as parameters the address of the client and the message to be sent.

```cpp
void   Server::reply(Client &client, std::string msg)
{
    msg += "\r\n";
    send(client.get_fd(), msg.c_str(), msg.length(), 0);
}
```

## Client Class

## Channel Class

#

## Commands

The protocol for each command will follow the same principles almost everytime.

First, check to see if the Client is registered.
If not, send reply 451.

Second, separate the the command.

Third, apply the changes to all members.

### Invite
Usage:
```
/invite <nick> <#channel>

```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " INVITE " + invitedNick + " :" + channel_name;  
```

```
/join <#channel>
```

Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " JOIN " + channel_name;
