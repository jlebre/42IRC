# 42IRC
This project is about creating an IRC server.
\
Using HexChat (an actual IRC client) to connect to the server and test it.

Internet is ruled by solid standards protocols that allow connected computers to interact with each other.
\
Itâ€™s always a good thing to know.

## Intro

### What is an IRC
Internet Relay Chat

## Setup
```
git clone https://www.github.com/jlebre/42IRC.git
cd 42IRC/ft_irc
make a
```

"make a" deletes all files, compiles the program, and runs it in port 6667 and using "hello" as password.

#

## Step by step
### Setup Server Socket

#

## EPOLL
Similar to poll(), but it is more efficient in handling a large number of fds.

### Functions
1. int epoll_create1(int flags):
\
Create an epoll instance and returns the file descriptor referring to that instance.

2. int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int option, int fd, struct epoll_event *event):
\
Manages the list of file descriptors that the epoll instance should monitor.
    "option" can be EPOLL_CTL_ADD, EPOLL_CTL_MOD, EPOLL_CTL_DEL.

```
EPOLL_CTL_ADD:
Add an entry to the interest list of the epoll file
descriptor, epfd.  The entry includes the file descriptor,
fd, a reference to the corresponding open file description.

EPOLL_CTL_MOD:
Change the settings associated with fd in the interest
list to the new settings specified in event.

EPOLL_CTL_DEL:
Remove (deregister) the target file descriptor fd from the
interest list.  The event argument is ignored and can be
NULL (but see BUGS below).
```

3. int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int max_events, int timeout):
\
Waits for events on the epoll instance.

```cpp
void	Server::init_poll()
{
	_event.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLOUT;
	_event.data.fd = _sock.fd;
	_events[0].data.fd = _sock.fd;

	event_fd = epoll_create1(0);

	epoll_ctl(event_fd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, _sock.fd, &_event);

	memset(&_events, 0, sizeof(_events));
}
```
```
EPOLLIN:
Available for read operations.

EPOLLOUT:
Available for write operations.
```

#

# Classes
## Server Class

To send a message to the client we use the function reply, that takes as parameters the address of the client and the message to be sent.

```cpp
void   Server::reply(Client &client, std::string msg)
{
    msg += "\r\n";
    send(client.get_fd(), msg.c_str(), msg.length(), 0);
}
```

## Client Class

## Channel Class

#

## Commands

The protocol for each command will follow the same principles almost everytime.

First, check to see if the Client is registered.
If not, send reply 451.

Second, separate the the command.

Third, apply the changes to all members.

### Invite
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " INVITE " + invitedNick + " :" + channel_name;  
```

### Join
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " JOIN " + channel_name;  
```

### Kick
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " KICK " + channel_name + " " + clientToKickNick + " :" + reason;  
```

### Mode
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " MODE " + channel_name + " " + mode;  

```

### Nick
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + oldNick + " NICK :" + newNick;  
```

### Part
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " PART " + channel_name + " :" + reason;  
```

### Pass
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = "PASS " + password;  
```

### Privmsg
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " PRIVMSG " + target + " :" + message;  
```

### Quit
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " QUIT :" + reason;  
```

### Topic
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = ":" + clientNick + " TOPIC " + channel_name + " :" + topic;  
```

### User
Message sent to the client:
```cpp
std::string msg = "USER " + username + " 0 * :" + realname;  
```
